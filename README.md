## Requirements

1. `truffle` with solc 0.5.0

2. `ganache-cli` or `ganache` desktop app

3. For production, a Ropsten or Main Network Full Node (infura.io is a nice tool to use).

## Deployment and Testing

To deploy, you can simply run:

```bash
# Install node modules
yarn # or npm i

# For localhost
truffle deploy --network=development

# For ropsten
truffle deploy --network=ropsten

# For mainnet
truffle deploy --network=mainnet
```

To test, you can run:

```bash
truffle test
```

## Configuring

In order to deploy to either Main or Ropsten Networks, you need to have a private key with enough Ethereum (0.1 ETH should be more then enough).

All you need to do to configure the contract for deployment is export the necessary environment variables:

```bash
# Configuring Ropsten
export ROPSTEN_KEY='PRIVATE KEY STRING OR 12 WORD PASS PHRASE'
export ROPSTEN_RPC='URL FOR ROPSTEN NODE'

# Configuring Main
export MAINNET_KEY='PRIVATE KEY STRING OR 12 WORD PASS PHRASE'
export MAINNET_RPC='URL FOR MAIN NODE'
```

You can go to infura.io if you need to access to a full node and don't want to wait to sync your own full node.

## Live Transaction Info

The transaction information for the mainnet:

```
tx.info.mainnet.json
```

and ropsten:

```
tx.info.ropsten.json
```

Are the smart contracts actively used by Decentralized Creator.
